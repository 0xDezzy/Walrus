Here's a table of the current devices / card type pairs we support and in what manner.

(Yes - there's not a lot right now for our alpha release, but extra device and card support is definitely next on [the roadmap](/roadmap/), and is easy to implement!)

**Key**: R = reading, W = writing, E = emulating, WIP = work in progress, NSY = Not Supported Yet (by hardware)
