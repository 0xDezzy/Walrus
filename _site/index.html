<h1 id="walrus---card-cloning-made-simple">Walrus - Card Cloning Made Simple</h1>

<p>Walrus enables you to use your existing contactless card cloning devices with your Android device. Using a simple interface, cards can be read into a wallet to be written or emulated later.</p>

<p>Designed for physical security assessors, Walrus has features that will help you in your next red team engagement.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>

<p>As an example, Walrus can be used to tap into the power of the Tastic RFID Thief long range card reader, allowing for walk-by cloning of a victimâ€™s access card in a matter of seconds. The cloned card can then quickly be emulated or written to a blank card via an attached Proxmark.</p>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/247914436" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p></p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>Walrus does not implement all of the functionality supported by a given card device and card type pair, instead choosing to implement only the subset that is common across most devices and most useful in real-world usage. This includes basic tasks such as card reading, writing and emulation, as well as some device-specific functionality such as antenna tuning or device configuration.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<h3 id="multi-device-support">Multi-device Support</h3>

<p>Walrus currently supports the <a href="https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3">Proxmark3</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/emsec/ChameleonMini">Chameleon Mini</a>, with more device support on the way.</p>

<h3 id="bulk-card-reading">Bulk Card Reading</h3>

<p>Bulk card reading continually reads cards from a device until manually stopped. This lets you easily capture multiple cards as you move around your target location. Vibration feedback lets you know when you have successfully read a card without the need for any interaction with your card reading or Android devices. Simultaneous device I/O support lets you use different devices to read multiple card types all at once or write a card on a device while you are still reading from another device.</p>

<h3 id="location-awareness">Location Awareness</h3>

<p>Each time a card is seen, it is recorded with your location, making it easier to determine where the card may grant access to.</p>

<h3 id="brute-forcing-coming-soon">Brute-forcing (Coming soon)</h3>

<p>If you find a card reader that needs to be opened, your stored cards can be emulated through a device one by one. The cards are ordered in increasing distance between the reader and the location the card was captured, increasing the chances of a matching card being emulated and the reader granting access.</p>

<h3 id="shareable-cards-coming-soon">Shareable Cards (Coming Soon)</h3>

<p>Cards can be shared between instances of Walrus and exported for external use. This can be useful if there are two consultants on an engagement; one consultant can be tasked with cloning an access card from an employee in the field while the second consultant can write or emulate the access card at a reader.</p>
